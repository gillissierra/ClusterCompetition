ABOUT
clusterCompetition.py compares two clustering algorithms, K-Means and 
Agglomerative Clustering with Ward Linkage.
The data that is clustered are expression values of the gene INPP4B 
collected from studies of Acute Myeloid Leukemia. The data is retrieved 
from the Gene Expression Omnibus database via the R wrapper, RPy2.

TODO
Add more methods to have data set grabbing functions to get rid of 
repetition in code. More knowledge of data structures and RPy2 robjects 
would need to be known in order to store these in a loopable array
