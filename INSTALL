INSTALL
In Anoconda Prompt:
conda install -c r rpy2

Run the install script GEOqueryInstall.py

The necessary R packages will be downloaded to your R folder
by the command biocInstaller.biocLite("GEOquery") on line 33 which
will then throw an error.
Copy the GEOquery folder from C:\Program Files\R\<R version>\library
and paste it into C:\Users\<User name>\Anaconda3\Lib\R\library
This allows the R under Anaconda to have the required packages.
If using Spyder, restart it.

The clusterCompetition.py can now be run.
